### Due Date
Due Date: Midnight on Friday of Week 3 (Jan 24 with graceful (no penalty) extension till 9am on Jan 25 (Sat)). No late submission will be accepted.

### Problem 1.1: Program your own Web Crawler
Feel free to use any open source crawler as the code base. Write your focused crawler, such as crawling only CoC website or crawling only healthcare web pages. You are expected to crawl at least 1000 pages.

Here are some steps you may follow in a similar way as those in Option 1.1:
- Select a seed URL to initialize your Web crawler, such as cc.gatech.edu, and you are expected to crawl at least 1000 URLs.
- Show the design of your Web archive to store your crawled web pages, the keywords (subjects) you have extracted.
- Plot the crawl speed in terms of the number of keywords you have extracted and the number of URLs you have extracted and the number of URLs you are able to crawl.
- Discuss your experience and lessons learned. Predict how long your crawler may need to work in order to crawl 10 millions of pages and 1 billion of pages.

## Deliverable:
- Source code and executable with readme.
- Discuss the design of your crawler: Pros and cons.
- Screen Shots of your Web Crawlerâ€™s Command lines or GUIs
- Crawl Statistics (Crawl speedðŸ¡ª #pages/minute, ratio of #URL crawled / #URL to be crawled, etc.) in excel plots or tabular format
- Discuss your experience and lessons learned.
